# Programming Languages Overview

**Programming** - giving instructions to a computer to execute.

**Computers** - machines that receive input and give output.

**Binary** - programming language made only of `1`s and `0`s - the only language that computers understand.

The `1`s and `0`s represent the state of ONs and OFFs in the billions of switches on a CPU chip.

Programming languages are tools that translate the `1`s and `0`s into something that we humans can understand and write.

## Low-level and High-level

_Programming languages fall into two different classifications:_

**Low-level** programming languages are closer to machine code (binary).

Low-level languages are difficult to read and write, but instead they are fast and offer precise control over how the computer will function.

**High-level** programming languages are closer to how humans communicate.

High-level languages are easier to read and write, but they do take more time to translate into machine code for the computer.

As computers have become more powerful, the difference in runtime between low-level and high-level programming languages is often only milliseconds. As a result, high-level languages are more effective.
